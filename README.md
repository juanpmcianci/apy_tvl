# Readme

The main two pieces of code are in src. Specifically:

- `AAVE_query.py` Performs the required query for AAVE.  This utilies AAVE's (V3) subgraph data in order to query the relevant quantities. 
- `Compound_query.py` Performs the required query for Compound. **NOTE** You will need to add your own INFURA node on the code base.  It utilizes Compound III.

- WIP!
